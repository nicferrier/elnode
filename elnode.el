;;; Style note
;;
;; This codes uses the Emacs style of:
;;
;;    elnode--private-function
;;
;; for private functions.


;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is an elisp version of the popular node.js asynchronous
;; webserver toolkit.
;;
;; You can define HTTP request handlers and start an HTTP server
;; attached to the handler.  Many HTTP servers can be started, each
;; must have its own TCP port.  Handlers can defer processing with a
;; signal (which allows comet style resource management)
;;
;; See elnode-start for how to start an HTTP server.

  "Start a server using REQUEST-HANDLER.

REQUEST-HANDLER will handle requests on PORT on HOST (which is
'localhost' by default).

REQUEST-HANDLER is a function which is called with the request.
The function is called with one argument, which is the
http-connection.

You can use functions such as `elnode-http-start' and
`elnode-http-send-body' to send the http response.

Example:

  (defun nic-server (httpcon)
    (elnode-http-start httpcon 200 '(\"Content-Type\" . \"text/html\"))
    (elnode-http-return httpcon \"<html><b>BIG!</b></html>\"))
  (elnode-start 'nic-server)

Now visit http://127.0.0.1:8000

If PORT is non-nil, then run server on PORT, otherwise default to
8000.

If HOST is non-nil, then run the server on the specified local IP
address, otherwise use localhost.  A few names are predefined:

  \"localhost\" is 127.0.0.1
  \"*\" is 0.0.0.0

Additionally, you may specifiy an IP address, e.g \"1.2.3.4\"

Note that although HOST may be specified, elnode does not
disambiguate on running servers by HOST.  So you cannot start two
elnode servers on the same port on different hosts.

DEFER-MODE may be used to control how deferred handlers are
managed for this server.

SERVICE-MAPPINGS is an alist of service resource symbols mapped
to integer port numbers.  This can be supplied to elnode-start to
allow it to map service resources defined by handlers to
different TCP ports and therefore different Emacs instances.

The list of SERVICE-MAPPINGS is also used to start ancilliary
port servers.  Ancilliary port servers should be automatically
stopped when the main server is stopped."

WARNING: this resolution order is likely to change because,
especially when developing `default-directory' can be quite
random (change buffer, change `default-directory').

Optionally you may specify extra keyword arguments:

:PREAMBLE a string of data to send before the file.

:PREAMBLE is most useful for prefixing syntax to some other file,
for example you could prefix an XML file with XSL transformation
statements so a compliant user-agent will transform the XML.

:MIME-TYPES is an optional alist of MIME type mappings to help
resolve the type of a file.

If :REPLACEMENTS is specified it should be a hash-table or an
association list used to supply values for templating.  When
templating is specified the targetfile is not sent directly but
opened in Emacs as a buffer and transformed through the
templating system before being sent.  See
`elnode--buffer-template' for details of templating.

REPLACEMENTS can optionally be a function in which case the
return value is expected to be the hash-table or alist for the
variables.  The function should have no arguments but two
variables are bound during the function's execution
`elnode-replacements-httpcon' is the `httpcon' and
`elnode-replacements-targetfile' is the targetfile to be
delivered.

  "Define an Elnode authentication scheme.

An authentication scheme consists of the following attributes:

TEST what sort of test is used to test the authentication, by
default this is `:cookie'.  No other authentication tests are
possible right now but in the future there might be many (there
might also be a general `:function' test that allows calling of a
function to implement the test).

COOKIE-NAME is used when the TEST is `:cookie'.  It is the name
of the cookie to use for authentication.  By default this is
`elnode-auth'.  It must be specified as a string.

AUTH-TEST is a function to implement checking authentiation of
users.  It is passed a username and must respond with a token
that can be checked against the value returned by the hashing
function (see MAKE-HASH and `elnode-auth-make-hash' which is the
default hashing function).  AUTH-TEST can be nil in which case a
default will be used, based on AUTH-DB using
`elnode-auth-default-test'.

MAKE-HASH is a function to implement the construction of a hash
token for authentication.  It takes a username and password and
must produce the same value as AUTH-TEST.

AUTH-DB is the `db' used for authentication information.
It is used as the authority of information on users.  By default
this is `elnode-auth-db'.

FAILURE-TYPE is what to do if authentication fails.  Currently
only `:redirect' is supported.  To redirect on failure means to
send a 302 with a location to visit a login page.  :FAILURE-TYPE
is `:redirect' by default.

REDIRECT is where to redirect to if FAILURE-TYPE is `:redirect'.
By default this is \"/login/\".  If SENDER is not nil then a
dispatcher made with `elnode-dispatcher' or
`elnode-hostpath-dispatcher' that is told about this auth scheme
will dispatch a path naming REDIRECT to SENDER.

SENDER is an Elnode handler taking additional parameters of
`target' and `redirect'.  By default this is the function
`elnode-auth-login-sender'.  Specify a different function if you
want to totally change the login page."
