;;; Commentary:
;;
;; These are the tests for elnode-db.
;;
;; elnode-db needs it's own tests because elnode-db is a depend of
;; elnode itself and thus it gets loaded before elnode.  If it did not
;; have it's own tests it would cause a dependancy on ERT for all of
;; elnode.

;; This code originated from this gmane thread:
;; http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.devel/115821 by Thierry Volpiatto

;;; Source code

;;; Style note

;; This codes uses the Emacs style of:

;;    elnode--private-function
;;
;; for private functions.
